# omni-crypt

Simple tools and utilities for encryption and decryption. 

(Obviously, there are no guarantees any of these tools are secure or that they use computer security best practices, 
so they should not be used for anything serious.)

This is still a work in progress, and although there may be some unit-tests, documentation is still rather spotty.
